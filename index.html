	<h1 style="color:orangered;">About Me, MEGAN MILLER</h1>

<br/>

<div style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;">
	<h2 style="color:olive;">Lil' ole Lake Crystal</h2>

	<p style="color:darkgoldenrod;">
		I am from a small town only fifteen minutes southwest of Mankato. I graduated in 2016 from a class of sixty-nine people, nine of which dropped out of high school... so technically I only graduated with sixty people..
	</p>

	<p style="color:darkgoldenrod;">
		In a town so small (2,477 people accoring to worldpopulationreview.com), you get to know everyone.. and everyone's mom.. and dad.. and siblings.. heck, maybe even their grandma. Did I mention you know where people and what kind of car they drive or maybe even their birthdays?
	</p>

	<p style="color:darkgoldenrod;">
		Growing up, my mom has always lived in Lake Crystal. My dad, however, has live in Lake Crystal, Mankato and also Garden City. He is currently living in Garden City, which is surprisingly smaller than Lake Crystal. Accoring to the same website I provided earlier, worldpopulationreview.com, Garden City has a population of 685 folks.

	<h2 style="color:olive;">Fam Life</h2>

	<p style="color: darkgoldenrod;">
		I am the the oldest of six kiddos. Well, ~technically~ two are full-siblings and three are half-siblings. I see and know my half-siblings enough that the "half" isn't really important. Here's the ages of us kiddos and some fun facts about each of us - in order, too!</p>
